      - Original Date: December 7th
      - Date Changed: December 9th 
      - Changes done on December 7th: Added a new functional navigation header that has been assisted with JavaScript. The new nav bar
        is mostly made from pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. When the user resizes the webpage, the nav will resize to 
        a user friendly interface. 
      - Changes done on December 9th: Added multiple comments and edited links for the nav. 
      - Purpose: The purpose of implementing this code is to demonstrate our knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript that we learnt
        in class. Also, to provide a user friendly experience.
      - Sources: Some elements are derived from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown_navbar.asp

      - Date: November 15th
      - Changes done on November 15th: Added the logo png in the template. 
      - Purpose: The purpose of the logo is to create a professional image for the webpage. The image is a nice tone of teal blue, 
      as we wanted our company to be associated with a calm blue colour with an Earthy tone. 
      - Sources: I, the author Aida, created the logo image.

      - Original Date: November 15th
      - Changes done on December 15th: Created a slogan and arrow button. 
      - Changes done on December 7th: Added a new hero image and added multiple comments.
      - Purpose: The purpose is for the user to be greeted by the image, when they first enter the site. Primarily used for 
      aesthetic purposes, and we wanted to show our use of pure HTML and CSS. We chose this hero image as it was a beautiful 
      mix of land, water and sky. As well, the purpose of the slogan is for the company to have a catchy, but professional catch phrase. 
      - Sources: The hero image is from https://pixabay.com/photos/bc-beautiful-beauty-blue-british-3826680/ 
      Photographer and Uploader of the image from PixaBay used: jameswheeler (Free for commercial use.) 
      We also used https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_hero_image.asp as inspiration. 
      The slogan and arrow button are created by me, Aida Tuhcic.

          <p>" The staff at G&#233;oinformatique were friendly and helped my company integrate several web-based maps into our existing website. 
               They were able to start working on our project right away and finished before their estimated deadline. 
               Everything works perfectly and our customers have already begun commenting on how much more user-friendly the website is. "</p>

          <p>" I usually have issues with any GIS analysis because of the amount of time they take. 
               It feels like too much effort all too often. This time though I was very surprised, the team did an amazing job and kept on schedule just as promised. 
               Looking forward to working with them in the future. "</p>

               I am always impressed regardless of how many ever times I work with them. 
               You can sense the passion of the G&#233;oinformatique team when you are around them.

          <p>" After hiring them to create several land-use maps for our city, we were so impressed with the quality of the work that we expanded the scope of the job to include making the maps into decorative prints, which now hang in our lobby. 
               They were very flexible with last-minute requests, and even gave us a discount on the prints since they had already done much of the mapping. 
               Thanks, G&#233;oinformatique! "</p>
